# Q1 Engineering Arduino Projects
Arduino code showcasing lcd screens, potentiometers, photointerupters, dc motors, and leds as well as the various ways to utilize them.
Mostly helpful as a reference for setup and general code using each piece. 
## [LED Blink Revisited]( blinking_fade_w_dash/blinking_fade_w_dash.ino)
My goal in this assignment was to wire an led with a breadboard and learn to utilize Sublime in order to make the LED blink and fade out. In order to add a secondary layer to the assignment 
### Lessons Learned/Important points
It had been a while since I had utilized an arduino. The coding was not a problem for me but it took a minute or two to remember how to wire things. Additionally, I had not utilized ```analogWrite()``` very heavily in the past so special attention had to be given to putting the pins in the right ports as not all of the pins are analog compatible.

## [Hello LCD]( lcd_hello/lcd_hello.ino)
Learned how to use an LCD screen and utilize packages in sublime in order to display ``` Hello World ``` and the number of seconds since the program began. 
### Lessons Learned/Important points
When not using a backpack as in the next assignment, the wiring proved challenging and required a lot of attention to detail. I utilized [this guide](https://programmingelectronics.com/how-to-set-up-an-lcd-with-arduino/) to generally check my wiring and understanding. The code provided no new challenges.
